Create a counter function that will create a counter and have one optional parameter of type number. The function call must return an object (counter) with three methods: increase, decrease, value.

Calling the value method should return the current value of the counter, increse should increase it by 1, and decrease should decrease it.

A call to the counter function must create an independent counter, which means that calling methods on one counter must not affect any other counter in any way.
